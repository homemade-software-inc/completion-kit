# Changelog

All notable changes to CompletionKit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **License:** CompletionKit 0.3.0 and later are licensed under the Business
  Source License 1.1 with a 3-year Change Date to GPL v3. You may use
  CompletionKit freely for any purpose — including production — except to
  offer it to third parties as a hosted or managed service whose primary
  value is CompletionKit itself. Versions 0.2.x and earlier remain
  MIT-licensed and are unaffected; anyone relying on MIT can pin to 0.2.x.
  See `LICENSE` for full terms and the Additional Use Grant.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Optional `tenant_scope` / `tenant_scope_columns` config hooks for multi-tenant host apps. No behavior change when unset.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Criteria` renamed to `Metric Group` across the entire product.
  REST API paths `/api/v1/criteria` → `/api/v1/metric_groups`. MCP tools
  `criteria_*` → `metric_groups_*`. Ruby class `CompletionKit::Criteria` →
  `CompletionKit::MetricGroup`, `CompletionKit::CriteriaMembership` →
  `CompletionKit::MetricGroupMembership`. Web routes `/completion_kit/criteria` →
  `/completion_kit/metric_groups`. Database tables renamed in place; no
  data migration needed. No backwards-compatibility aliases.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `evaluation_steps` column removed from the `Metric` model and
  all associated UI, REST API, and MCP tool surfaces. Scoring now relies on
  the metric's `instruction` and `rubric_bands` alone.

### Known limitations

- Standalone app uses the `:async` queue adapter (in-process only). Solid
  Queue migration is planned for 0.2.0.

## [0.1.0.rc1] - 2026-04-15

Release candidate 1 for 0.1.0. Published to RubyGems as
`completion-kit 0.1.0.rc1` for pre-release validation before cutting
the real 0.1.0.

Initial public release of CompletionKit, a Rails engine for testing and
evaluating GenAI prompts across multiple providers.

### Added

- **Prompts, Runs, Datasets, Metrics, and Criteria** — core models for
  defining prompts with variable placeholders, running them against CSV
  datasets, and scoring outputs with LLM judges against user-defined
  criteria.
- **Provider credentials** — encrypted storage for LLM API keys with
  auto-seeding from environment variables, masked display, and per-provider
  usage stats. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (or any OpenAI-compatible
  local endpoint), and OpenRouter.
- **Model discovery** — asynchronous fetching of available models per
  provider with real-time progress updates. OpenRouter and Ollama discovery
  trust the upstream API's model list and skip per-model probing, keeping
  discovery fast for providers that publish capability metadata.
- **REST JSON API** — Bearer token authenticated API exposing full CRUD
  for Prompts, Runs, Datasets, Metrics, Criteria, and ProviderCredentials;
  nested read-only Responses under Runs; and `POST /api/v1/runs/:id/generate`
  and `/judge` process actions that return `202 Accepted` for async
  processing.
- **MCP server** — 36 tools mirroring the REST API, exposing CompletionKit
  to agent clients via the Model Context Protocol. Install cards with
  one-click copy for Claude Code and other MCP-compatible clients.
- **Web UI** — session-based login, onboarding dashboard showing only
  remaining setup steps, prompt and run management, Turbo Stream live
  updates for run progress and response rows, and a progress bar partial.
  Model dropdowns are grouped by provider, with OpenRouter models split
  further by upstream namespace.
- **Background jobs** — `GenerateJob` and `JudgeJob` for async processing,
  with Solid Queue configured in the standalone app.
- **Suggestion history** — AI-assisted prompt improvement suggestions
  persisted to the database, tracked with applied status, and surfaced in
  the prompt UI for evolution history.
- **Temperature control** — per-run temperature slider with info tooltip
  (default 1.0).
- **Retry failed runs** — "Retry" action that only appears on failed runs.
- **Edit-as-new-run** — editing a run with existing responses creates a
  new run, preserving the original.
- **Judge input awareness** — judge is passed the input data so it can
  verify claims against the actual input, not just the output.
- **API reference page** — per-endpoint documentation with params,
  copy-to-clipboard examples, and MCP tab shown by default.
- **Standalone app** — bundled Rails app under `standalone/` for local
  development and self-hosting, with dotenv support and Active Record
  encryption for stored provider API keys.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflow and Dependabot.
- **100% test coverage** — line and branch coverage enforced in CI across
  440+ RSpec examples.
