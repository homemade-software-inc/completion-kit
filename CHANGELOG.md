## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-15

Initial public release of CompletionKit, a Rails engine for testing and
evaluating GenAI prompts across multiple providers.

### Added

- **Prompts, Runs, Datasets, Metrics, and Criteria** — core models for
  defining prompts with variable placeholders, running them against CSV
  datasets, and scoring outputs with LLM judges against user-defined
  criteria.
- **Provider credentials** — encrypted storage for LLM API keys with
  auto-seeding from environment variables, masked display, and per-provider
  usage stats. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (or any OpenAI-compatible
  local endpoint), and OpenRouter.
- **Model discovery** — asynchronous fetching of available models per
  provider with real-time progress updates. OpenRouter and Ollama discovery
  trust the upstream API's model list and skip per-model probing, keeping
  discovery fast for providers that publish capability metadata.
- **REST JSON API** — Bearer token authenticated API exposing full CRUD
  for Prompts, Runs, Datasets, Metrics, Criteria, and ProviderCredentials;
  nested read-only Responses under Runs; and `POST /api/v1/runs/:id/generate`
  and `/judge` process actions that return `202 Accepted` for async
  processing.
- **MCP server** — 36 tools mirroring the REST API, exposing CompletionKit
  to agent clients via the Model Context Protocol. Install cards with
  one-click copy for Claude Code and other MCP-compatible clients.
- **Web UI** — session-based login, onboarding dashboard showing only
  remaining setup steps, prompt and run management, Turbo Stream live
  updates for run progress and response rows, and a progress bar partial.
  Model dropdowns are grouped by provider, with OpenRouter models split
  further by upstream namespace.
- **Background jobs** — `GenerateJob` and `JudgeJob` for async processing,
  with Solid Queue configured in the standalone app.
- **Suggestion history** — AI-assisted prompt improvement suggestions
  persisted to the database, tracked with applied status, and surfaced in
  the prompt UI for evolution history.
- **Temperature control** — per-run temperature slider with info tooltip
  (default 1.0).
- **Retry failed runs** — "Retry" action that only appears on failed runs.
- **Edit-as-new-run** — editing a run with existing responses creates a
  new run, preserving the original.
- **Judge input awareness** — judge is passed the input data so it can
  verify claims against the actual input, not just the output.
- **API reference page** — per-endpoint documentation with params,
  copy-to-clipboard examples, and MCP tab shown by default.
- **Standalone app** — bundled Rails app under `standalone/` for local
  development and self-hosting, with dotenv support and Active Record
  encryption for stored provider API keys.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflow and Dependabot.
- **100% test coverage** — line and branch coverage enforced in CI across
  440+ RSpec examples.
